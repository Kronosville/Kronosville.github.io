<p>
  Hello! This is the page for the Server-Wide Kronosville Head Hunt.
  <br>
  Various heads are hidden all around the server. Here is an example:

<p>
  If you find something like this, please take <i>one</i> of the heads
  in the chest, and keep it.
  <br>
  There may at some point be prizes...

  <h3>IMPORTANT:</h3>
  Do not place the head, for it will lose its name and lore!
  You may, however, put it in an item frame.
  <br><br>
  Lead the head hunt begin!
